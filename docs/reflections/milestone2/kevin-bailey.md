This was really the first time I have really ever done TDD for something like this, and it made things slower at first, but it was really nice having those tests from the beginning, so that when changes happened, we didn't have to do a whole lot to verify.

I would say the most challenging part of implementing the CLI MVP was: a) picking up python again after a really long time, and b) collaborating with others on a larger scale thing. It

# Sprint 3 Reflection Questions

This sprint was a lot harder for me this time around. Our group struggled with dividing up labor and I feel like I probably ended up doing too much.

It was pretty fun creating a GUI, I like the more visual development process, but I just think i'm more used to more streamlined or customizeable packages for other languages. The main struggle was getting the GUI to work with our "backend" code, and I think we could have done a better job of delegating that work.
