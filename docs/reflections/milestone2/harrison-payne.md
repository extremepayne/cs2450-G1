# Individual reflections: Harrison Payne

As for the individual reflection questions, I have no answers, because I didn't write the code this sprint. That was Kevin and Ryker's job, and Chun wrote the test report. I was busy keeping up with all the documentation.

But I can tell you that I know from previous experiences that test-driven development can be a little awkward and slow but it has a better chance of producing code that works well. It forces you to think about how your code should work before writing it, which is a boon in and of itself, and it leaves you with a comprehensive testing suite at the end of it which you can use. This test suite can be used to prove that your code works now and also can be helpful for regression testing in the future.
