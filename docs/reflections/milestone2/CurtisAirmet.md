# Individual reflections: Curtis Airmet

My focus for this spring was finishing the use case diagram and updating the SRS. I did not do any coding for this sprint, but I know that TDD can be very helpful. It helps eliminate biases towards your own code by making you wring the tests first. Keeping the tests in mind can also make the coding process easier.
