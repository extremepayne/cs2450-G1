## Sprint 2 Retrospective

### What went well

We made a lot of code in a short time  
Organization was good â€“ we communicated well over discord, got everything done before the deadline with minimal panic  
Learning how to write good test reports  
Good collaboration

### What can be improved

Division of labor between developers/testers was lopsided. Kevin, who is a dev again next sprint, will strive to improve here.  
More granular reporting of the automated tests.  
End-heavy sprint workload.

### Actionable items for next sprint

Kevin will divide work more evenly  
Developers and testers can make the test report more explicit  
Make more things due at the mid-sprint meeting
